# vue-template-ckeditor5-classic

CKEditor 5 Classic integrated with [Create Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html).

## Usage

To use this template as your starting point, you can use `degit`. It makes copies of git repositories.

For example:

```
npx degit ckeditor/vue-template-ckeditor5-classic ckeditor-classic-demo
```

When you run `degit` some-user/some-repo, it will find the latest commit on https://github.com/some-user/some-repo and download the associated tar file to ~/.degit/some-user/some-repo/commithash.tar.gz if it doesn't already exist locally.
